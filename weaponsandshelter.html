<blockquote>

<p>What kind of gun? A hand gun and rifle with a scope will work best for getting rid of zombies. 
	A .22 will do for zombies when making headshots, no need to carry heavy ammo if you don't have to.</p>

<p>Your only foe won't, however, be zombies. You will be fighting off some survivors. 
You will need a shotgun for looters and crazies. 
It's a good idea to learn basic self-defense and hand to hand combat for both zombies and humans you will have to fight. </p>

<p>You will also need a quiet weapon. One that is effective, quiet and that you know how to wield. An axe, a machete, etc. If you can, make it carbon coated so it doesn't reflect light and draw attention. The less attention the better.</p>

<p>In a pinch, any blunt object will do though, just aim for the head and destroy the brain. </p>

<h4 align="center">Shelter</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Any place that has a minimal amount of entry and exit points on the ground level. If necessary, get to a second or third floor and destroy stairs with a sledge hammer. Ladders are your friend. </p>

<p>Avoid hospitals! This is where the infection will likely start and spread the quickest. 
Home is your best bet, but if you're in a city, get out. The less people around, the less zombies and you don't want to be where disease can spread easily. </p>


<p>A hammock tent if you must be out in the woods. Something you could possible place high up. </p>

<p>An RV would be ideal so you can sleep and keep on the move.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to know your entry and exit points and to fortify any weak spots with whatever you have available.</p>
