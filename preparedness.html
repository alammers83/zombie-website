you do? Would you be prepared?</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Chances are, no. Follow some of these
guidelines to get you started:</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>If your evacuation or shelter in place
plan includes more than just you, make sure you know where to meet the other
members of your party.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Visit the <a
href="http://www.redcross.org/prepare/location/home-family/plan">Red Cross</a> for
more info.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="Stockpile.pdf">Stock up
now</a>, because when the zombie apocalypse comes, stores are going to be swarming
with people clambering for supplies. Meanwhile, you get to sit back and avoid
leaving your fortified shelter.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Sterilize everything that has come into
contact with the infected with bleach with bleach and wear gloves.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>Protect your nose, mouth eyes and any
cuts and scrapes from zombie fluids. <br/>
<br/>
What you wear is about as important as what you are carrying with you. You don't
want zombies to be able drag you down or take a bite of your sweet human flesh.
Make sure if you have to go out, you have yourself covered.<br/>
<br/>
Wear a sturdy leather jacket, pants and gloves when outside your fortified
shelter. It'll offer you some protection against bites. Don't wear loose
fitting clothing that zombies can grab hold of.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>You can use duct tape to patch anything
and it's hard to bite through. (This goes for gear and pretty much anything
else. Stock up on a lot of duct tape.)<br/>
<br/>
If you have long hair, cut it or keep it tied up and not able to be grabbed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p><br/>
Keep your home, bags and bug out bags <a href="kits.pdf"/>ready to go!</p>
